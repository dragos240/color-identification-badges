# Color identification badges

![](preview.png)

## Who is this for?
This asset is for people who want to make it clear how social they are at any given time to improve their con experience. This is designed for Furality Luma Festival, but it can be used for any other con or social event with lots of people.

## How do I use it?
There is a unitypackage in the root of this repository. You can download that and import it directly. There are 3 badges in the sample scene, which can be copied over to your avi.

Alternatively, you can download the FBX model and textures folder to your project and create the materials yourself in unity (it uses one model with different textures).

## How can I customize it?
There is a Blender file that is used for export. You can use that to modify the actual geometry as you see fit. There's also a Substance Painter file if you have that. Additionally, there's a folder "intermediate files", which contains the image data used to make the textures in Substance Painter. Each of these has both a PNG raster file and a SVG vector file as its source.

## Can I distribute this?
Yep! I am distributing this asset for free, so feel free to pass it around. I do ask you link back to this repository so people can find the source if they want it, but it's not required you do so.
